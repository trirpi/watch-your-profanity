# Watch Your Profanity

Note, this is NSFW (In the sense of swear words and in the sense of mediocre spagetti code).
This project automatically insults people. It works on Slack, Steam, Wathsapp web, ... It only needs some sort of messaging app that sends the message when enter is pressed. It has a lovely gui. There are two wordlists with sweares provided. One with Dutch ones, and one with English ones. You have to edit the source code to use the other wordlist. It is a variable in one of the first lines.

Disclaimer: This was written at an age when I just started to program. It has it charms but is written quite sequentially.

## Installation

Ubuntu 16.04

    sudo apt install python3-tk
    pip3 install python3-xlib pyautogui
