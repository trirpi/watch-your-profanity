# Watch Your Profanity

Note, this is NSFW.
This project automatically insults people. It works on Slack, Steam, Wathsapp web, ... It only needs some sort of messaging app that sends the message when enter is pressed. It has a lovely gui. There are two wordlists with sweares provided. One with Dutch ones, and one with English ones. You have to edit the source code to use the other wordlist. It is a variable in one of the first lines.

## Installation

Ubuntu 16.04

    sudo apt install python3-tk
    pip3 install python3-xlib pyautogui

Now you can run it!
